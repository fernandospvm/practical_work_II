CHALLENGES I FOUND


- During theh project, I found various difficulties I had to deal with, such as finding some really silly mistakes I had made in the code (which took a lot of time to fix)
- Another challenge I had to deal with was the amount of styles and hours I had to dedicate to have the style I wanted in every part.
- Another thing I found difficult to find was the folder depth. This was due to the problems I had to go to a less deep folder in order to call the CSS file with the styles of that html file, having to ask colleagues why would that happen and finally fining a solution.


CONCLUSSIONS:
- The proyect taught me that web development is not that easy and that to develop a web, you need a lot of hours of work and dedication, specially for the CSS files.
- Also, I found out that I stayed more time fixing errors and mistakes thank coding on itself.
- But my final conclussion is that despite the dedicated hours to do this, I have been able to test out the skills and things learnt during de FCE class, being able to use efficiently CSS and html.
