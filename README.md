CHALLENGES I FOUND


- During the project, I found various difficulties I had to deal with, such as finding some really silly mistakes I had made in the code (which took a lot of time to fix)
- Another challenge I had to deal with was that I made for each hmtl file, its own styles.css file. Being the main problem at the end when merging all of them into one only file.

- Another thing I found was hot to call the styles.css file in deeper html files (the ones in the pusblic folder), until I realized i has ot put a ../ before the location of the folder to find it.

OTHER DETAILS

- I used github to be able to save the work while I did ir so not to lose it in case something happened, making commits every time a change was made.


CONCLUSSIONS:
- The proyect taught me that web development is not that easy and that to develop a web, you need a lot of hours of work and dedication, specially for the CSS files.
- Also, I found out that I stayed more time fixing errors and mistakes thank coding on itself.
- But my final conclussion is that despite the dedicated hours to do this, I have been able to test out the skills and things learnt during de FCE class, being able to use efficiently CSS and html.
