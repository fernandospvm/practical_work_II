# practical_work_II
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
- In this website, you will know a little bit more about me. You will also know why am I studying this degree, why I chose it and the outcomes it has, as well as the subjects that are taken in this degree, as well as the proffesional future that this degree has. You will find as well a brief article about phishing and not that much else.  

- During the practical Work II, I have been able to test the CSS and html skills that I have learnt and acquired through the course of fundamentals of computer engineering.

CHALLENGES I FOUND


- During theh project, I found various difficulties I had to deal with, such as finding some really silly mistakes I had made in the code (which took a lot of time to fix)
- Another challenge I had to deal with was the amount of styles and hours I had to dedicate to have the style I wanted in every part.
- Another thing I found difficult to find was the folder depth. This was due to the problems I had to go to a less deep folder in order to call the CSS file with the styles of that html file, having to ask colleagues why would that happen and finally fining a solution.


CONCLUSSIONS:
- The proyect taught me that web development is not that easy and that to develop a web, you need a lot of hours of work and dedication, specially for the CSS files.
- Also, I found out that I stayed more time fixing errors and mistakes thank coding on itself.
- But my final conclussion is that despite the dedicated hours to do this, I have been able to test out the skills and things learnt during de FCE class, being able to use efficiently CSS and html.
