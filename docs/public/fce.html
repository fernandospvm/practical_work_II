        <h1>Fundamentals of computer engineering (FCE). The beggining of the degree.</h1>
        <h2>This subject is an introduction of the things done in the computer science degree at the Universidad
            Francisco de Vitoria.</h2>
        <p> This subject is designed to give the student a global vision of computer engineering in various ways.
            Firstly, in an academical way, and secondly, but not for that less important (nontheless,probably more
            imprtant than the first one), as a job in a professional carreer.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This subject will permit the student to know the basics and fundamentals on which this degree is based
            (mathematics, phisics and ethics), the possible professional carreer paths this opens and finally, the role
            of a computer engineer in this society.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <h2>The course is divided in two parts:</h2>
        <h3>First Part: Theoretical foundations:</h3>
        <p> It covers three parts in content. Firstly, its history and impacts in society. Secondly, Information and
            data. Information representation and organization of information. And lastly, information processing,
            management and transmission. Paradigms and current trends in computer systems and apps. In this last one, we
            also learnt how to transform decimal numbers into binary.</p>
        <h3>Second Part: Pratical parts.</h3>
        <p>In the practical part of the course, we have learnt a lot about web development, making various projects of
            websites in class and in activities, learning how to use in an efficient way CSS and html.</p>
        <p>We have also learnt how to use github, the purpouses of using it and how to use the git bash terminal in
            order to have our projects and files organised (using branches and learning how to solve merging conflicts).
            As well as knowing how to publish a website using github.</p>
