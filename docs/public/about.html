                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Fernando San Prudencio. I'm a first year student in the double titulation in mathematics
                    and computer engineering in the univertity Francisco de Vitoria. My main interests are mathematics
                    and, programming and problem sollution, because these are fields that have the potential to make
                    this world a better place in any way possible. They also become more interesting because the longer
                    you progress in it the more complex and hard it becomes, making it a great challenge to deal with.
                </p>
                <h2>Academic Background</h2>
                <p>Right now, I'm studying mathematics and computer engineering, where I found out a very big
                    interest in programming, motivating me to take more programming courses on my own on other
                    languages we haven't seen through this first year, such as Java and Python, as well as an
                    increasing interest in linear algebra and advanced calculus problems</p>
                <p>I have studied and passed with good results a Technological Baccalaurate at Trinity College, in
                    Boadilla del Monte. My hometown</p>
                <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
                <p>Right now, my professional experience is not very much at all. I have taught maths and English
                    to younger people that were struggling at school with them.</p>
                <h2>Language Proficiency</h2>
                <p>I can talk fluidly Spanish (as it is my mother tongue) and English, holding a C2 certificate by
                    the Cambridge University</p>
                <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
                <p>I am consistent in problem solving, either applying a classical method or finding by other
                    secondary ways the sollution to the problem.</p>
                <p>I am also always open to teamwork, helping each other and solving problems and developing
                    projects in groups</p>
