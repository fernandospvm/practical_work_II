        <h2>Phishing. What is phishing and why is it so dangerous for society?</h2>
        <p>During the last few years, Internet has provided countless opportunities and made things that we thought that
            were impossible a few years ago. But nevertheless, there is also a bad side of the Internet that is not
            talked
            that much and has the potential to be one of the biggest threats to society. One of its most powerful
            weapons is
            called "phishing"</p>

                    <div class="link">
                        <p>Phishing is a kind of cyberattack where the cybercriminal tries to steal the victim's money,
                            identity or personal information (such as credit card numbers or passwords) in a website
                            that looks like the original website in which that information is put (like cloning a bank
                            webpage and there making them feel like they are putting their credit card number in a
                            reliable website, but they aren't). </p>

                    <div class="link">
                        <p>It is thought that the first phishing attacks happened during the mid-1990s, when a group of
                            hackers that were employees of AOL used instant messaging apps and email to get user's
                            credentials and enter into their accounts.</p>
                        <p>During the 2000s, phishing attacks became more organized and targeted. The first attempted
                            attack to a payment system is thought to have occurred in june 2001. Between 2004 and 2005,
                            aproximatedly 1.2 million users in the US were victims of phishing. With an aproximate loss
                            of 900 million USD.</p>
                        <p>In the image on your left, you can see an example of how a phishing attempt via email looks
                            like.</p>

                    <div class="link">
                        <p>Nowadays, phishing attacks are more present than ever, trying lots of new things in order to
                            steal your data, money, or any other confidential thing.</p>
                        <p>On your left, there is one phishing attempt they tried to make me by saying I had to pay a
                            fine due to surpassing the speed limit while driving. It was sent by a text message.</p>

                    <div class="link">
                        <p>To conclude, I think that phishing is one of the most powerful weapons criminals have right
                            now in order to get what they want, being able to even ask for a prce or something in
                            exchange to return them what is of them.</p>
                        <p>So, I advice to always be careful and make sure you know where are you putting your
                            credentials before putting them and stay safe!</p>
